# Web Monetization Explainer

Web Monetization is a proposed API standard that allows websites to request a
stream of very small payments from a user e.g. fractions of a cent.

This provides a framework for new revenue models for websites and web-based
services, as an alternative to subscription services or advertising, while
preserving the user's privacy.

In exchange for payments from the user, websites can provide the user with a
"premium" experience such as exclusive content or by removing advertising or
even the need to login to access content or services.

[Skip straight to code...](#handle-payments)

## Goals

Provide websites with a way to collect multiple small payments from users in
exchange for consuming the content and/or services on the website.

The experience must be frictionless for users. It must allow users to
pre-approve payments in aggregate or delegate the authorization of the
individual small payments to a component/service (a Web Monetization Agent) that
makes decisions about when to pay websites and how much without the need for
user interaction.

This system must preserve the user's privacy. It must not be possible for
websites to track users on the basis of the payments they make and it must not
be possible for the user's payment provider to get details of a user's browsing
history.

## Non-goals

Online purchases. Web Monetization is intended to enable very small payments.
This distinction is important because very small payments can be performed with
different levels of user consent to larger payments such as those used in
traditional e-commerce.

## Overview of the Flow

![](flow.svg)

### Glossary

- **Web Monetization Receiver**: An entity that accepts payments on behalf of
  the website (such as a digital wallet) and is capable of receiving
  micropayments. [More details...](./receiving.md)
- **Web Monetization Agent**: A component or service installed in the user agent
  that determines which websites to pay and how much to pay them.
- **Web Monetization Sender**: An entity that makes payments on behalf of the
  user (such as a digital wallet) and is capable of sending micropayments.
  [More details...](./sending.md)
- **User Agent**: The user's browser which has implemented the Web Monetization
  API and has an installed/registered _Web Monetization Agent_.
- **Web Page**: A page on the monetized website (that contains the necessary
  `meta` tag defining its receiving address)
- **Web Monetization Session**: Each page load or refresh is a unique session.
  The browser generates a unique identifier for the session which the website
  can use to correlate incoming payments at the **WM Receiver** to a client-side
  context.

### Prerequisites

- Users have an account or subscription with a **Web Monetization Sender (WM
  sender)** and have a **Web Monetization Agent** installed in their browser
  with the necessary authorization to initiate payments at the WM sender on
  behalf of the user.

- Websites sign up with (or run their own) **Web Monetization Receiver (WM
  receiver)**, responsible for accepting payments from their user's WM sender.

### Flow

_This flow is simplified to exclude some edge cases. Numbers correspond to the
diagram above._

1. When the user visits a website that uses Web Monetization the website
   provides the browser (via a `meta` tag in the `head` section) with a
   **Payment Pointer** where it accepts payments.
2. The browser uses its internal **Web Monetization Agent** to calculate an
   appropriate rate of payments to make to the website.
3. The browser generates a unique session id for this payment session.
4. The browser fetches a unique receiving address and secret for the session
   from the website's **WM Receiver**.
5. While the user has the page in focus the browser begins initiating payments
   at the calculated rate to the website, using the user's **WM Sender**.
   _(QUESTION: What about people listening to monetised music in a background
   tab?)_
6. The **WM Sender** sends the payment to the **WM Receiver**.
7. The **WM Sender** notifies the browser of successful payments.
8. The browser, in turn, raises an event that informs the web page of the
   payment.
9. The web page can connect to its own backend systems to verify that the
   payment was received (using the session id to correlate the incoming payment
   stream with the session id generated by the browser in the current page
   context).

## Why is a standard required?

There are many services attempting to provide alternative means to monetize the
Web and generate revenue for content creators and service providers without
selling ads.

However, most of these require that the user and the creator/producer/service
provider join a common network that offers to facilitate the transactions
between users and these services.

The result is a fragmented Web of closed content and service silos, rather than
the global and open Web we desire. Further, users sacrifice their privacy
because the service is both, collecting payments from the user and, paying out
to the creator/producer/service provider. It is therefor able to correlate these
and collect data about which services are used by users.

With Web Monetization the sender and the receiver are decoupled, using the
browser as an intermediary, the privacy of users is protected and payments can't
be used to track a user across sites.

## Design Discussion Points

This proposal is modelled on a working implementation that uses a browser
extension to provide the necessary browser-side functionality. However, there
are various design decisions that may be worth discussing further as a community
as we figure out how this could be built directly into browsers.

By bringing this work to the WICG, our goal is to get input from multiple WM
providers and implementors to refine the design and produce a W3C
standards-track specification.

### Declaritive vs Imperative API?

The current proposal is for a hybrid declarative and imperative API whereby
websites declare their ability to accept micropayments using a `<meta>` tag in
the page header and then access the global `monetization` object on the DOM to
track incoming payment events and react to these.

### Use updated Payment Request and Payment Handler APIs?

The Web Payments WG has designed two APIs that follow a similar pattern to Web
Monetization but for a different use case.

The Payment Request API is an imperative API that websites can use to request a
single discrete payment.

This is designed to always prompt the user for authorization as part of the flow
as it is designed for payment sizes where this is necessary. However, nothing
prevents this API also supporting a non-interactive flow that supports Web
Monetization use cases.

Further, the Payment Handler API aligns well with the model anticipated for Web
Monetization senders. A sender might manifest as a specialized Payment Handler
capable of returning not just a `PaymentRequestResponse` but also a handle to a
stream of micropayments.

### Streams

In-keeping with the trend toward streaming APIs, the API surface could be
updated to implement the stream API rather than repeated events.

## Concepts

Web Monetization depends on two critical technologies/concepts that enable open
and interoperable payments between providers and websites for very small
amounts.

### Interledger

Interledger is a payment messaging protocol for making payments of any size that
can be aggregated and settled over existing payment networks (including those
that do not support very small payment sizes or real time payments clearing).

The design of the protocol also allows for payments to be made that span
multiple underlying settlement networks, improving the interoperability and
reach of existing networks.

WM senders and WM receivers use the Interledger protocol to exchange payments.
The sender and receiver MAY be directly connected or may connect via one or more
intermediaries, this will be driven by the regulatory requirements and the
status of intermediaries as registered money services businesses.

For more details see https://interledger.org

### Payment Pointers

Payment Pointers are a convenient and concise way to express a URL that points
to a secure payment initiation endpoint on the Web.

Payment Pointers resolve to an HTTPS URL using simple conversion rules, allowing
systems that offer payment accounts to users, to give them a simple and easy to
remember identifier for the account, that is **safe to share** with 3rd parties
(i.e. not like a credit card number) and is immediately identifiable as a
payment account identifier.

An example of a Payment Pointer is: `$alice.wallet.example` or
`$wallet.example/alice` These resolve to
`https://alice.wallet.example/.well-known/pay` and
`https://wallet.example/alice` respectively.

Websites that use Web Monetization require a receiving address for their
payments (which they will get from their WM receiver) and insert this into the
appropriate `meta` tag as EITHER a URL or a Payment Pointer.

For more details see https://paymentpointers.org

## Getting Started

### Setup a receiving account

To use Web Monetization a website owner must have a financial account at a
service provider capable of receiving payments via the Interledger protocol
(i.e. a WM receiver).

Such a service (a digital wallet, bank, or similar) would provide the website
owner with a _**Payment Pointer**_ that serves as the public address for the
account.

> **Example:** Alice owns the website at _https://rocknrollblog.example_ and
> opens an account at _Secure Wallet Ltd._. Secure Wallet tells Alice that the
> Payment Pointer for her account is `$secure-wallet.example/~alice`. For
> privacy reasons Alice might also get the Payment Pointer
> `$secure-wallet.example/db74f8b4-d6a0-4489-a021-e785e5efb229` or be able to
> generate new addresses on demand (this would be a feature of her WM receiver).

### Add &lt;meta&gt; tag to website header

The website puts a `<meta>` tag in the header of the HTML documents it serves
with the `name` attribute equal to `monetization` and the `value` attribute
equal to the _Payment Pointer_ where the website will accept payments.

> **Example:** Alice puts the tag
> `<meta name="monetization" value="$secure-wallet.example/~alice">` into the
> `<head>` section of _https://rocknrollblog.example_.

Web Monetization only works on secure pages served over HTTPS (or
http://localhost for testing), in order to preclude bad actors like ISPs
injecting their own &lt;meta&gt; tags onto pages.

### Handle payments

When a user visits the page with a supported browser the website will find a
`document.monetization` object in the DOM. This will have a `state` property
that the website can check to determine if the user's provider has started
sending payments.

The `document.monetization` object will emit events when monetization starts and
then subsequently each time a payment is sent successfully by the provider. The
start event will contain a unique identifier for the payment stream that the
website can use to correlate the payments at its receiver with the user's
current browser session.

> **Example:** Alice adds some client-side code to her website that listens for
> the relevant monetization events and only shows advertising if she isn't
> receiving payments.

```html
<head>
  <meta name="monetization" value="$secure-wallet.example/~alice" />
</head>
<script>
  if (document.monetization) {
    document.monetization.addEventListener('monetizationstart', event => {
      // User has an open payment stream

      // Connect to backend to validate the session using the request id
      const { paymentPointer, requestId } = event.detail
      if (!isValidSession(paymentPointer, requestId)) {
        console.error('Invalid requestId for monetization')
        showAdvertising()
      }
    })

    document.monetization.addEventListener('monetizationprogress', event => {
      // A payment has been received

      // Connect to backend to validate the payment
      const {
        paymentPointer,
        requestId,
        amount,
        assetCode,
        assetScale
      } = event.detail
      if (
        isValidPayment(paymentPointer, requestId, amount, assetCode, assetScale)
      ) {
        // Hide ads for a period based on amount received
        suspendAdvertising(amount, assetCode, assetScale)
      }
    })
    // Wait 30 seconds and then show ads if advertising is no longer suspended
    setTimeout(maybeShowAdvertising, 30000)
  } else {
    showAdvertising()
  }
</script>
```

## Browser Behaviour

A browser supporting Web Monetization exposes a DOM object
`document.monetization` that implements
[EventTarget](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget) and
has a readonly `state` property. Initially the browser sets
`document.monetization.state` to `pending`.

1.  If the browser finds a valid Payment Pointer in a Web Monetization `<meta>`
    tag it generates a fresh UUID (version 4) and uses this as the **Session
    Id** from this point forward. **This Session Id MUST be unique per page
    load**, not per browser, session nor site.

    - The `<meta>` tags MUST be in the `<head>` of the document.
    - If the Web Monetization `<meta>` tags are malformed, the browser will
      abort Monetization processing here. The browser SHOULD report a warning
      via the console.
    - If the Web Monetization `<meta>` tags are well-formed, the browser should
      extract the Payment Pointer.

2.  The browser uses its internal Web Monetization Agent to calculate the rate
    it should pay the current website. If the result is 0 it aborts.

3.  The browser resolves the Payment Pointer and gets a unique
    `Interledger Address` and `Shared Secret` to use for the current session. It
    then begins sending payments via the WM Sender.

4.  The browser invokes the user's Web Monetization Sender
    [by emitting new `PaymentRequestEvent` events](./sending.md) with the
    necessary details.

5.  Once the sender has successfully completed the first payment with a non-zero
    amount, the browser sets `document.monetization.state` to `started` and then
    dispatches the `monetizationstart` event on `document.monetization`. The
    event's type is `monetizationstart`. The event has a `detail` field with an
    object containing the Payment Pointer and the Session ID.

6.  The browser continues to send payments at the calculated rate. Every time
    the it completes a payment (including the first payment) it dispatches a
    `monetizationprogress` event from `document.monetization`. The event has a
    `detail` field with an object containing the amount and currency of the
    payment.

7.  Payment continues until the user closes/leaves the page. The browser MAY
    decide to stop/start payment at any time, e.g. if the user is idle or
    backgrounds the page.

### Auditing / Dashboard

It must be possible for the user to get a summary of payments compiled by the
browser. These should be broken down by origin of the websites paid and the WM
sender making the payments, date and time to allow the user to reconcile data
from websites and WM senders about how much they have paid.

It should also be possible to tell the browser NOT to pay a particular website
any money. (Use case: web user needs to visit a monetized web site with
unpalatable viewpoints etc and doesn't want to contribute financially.)

_Bruce reckons that document.monetization shouldn't be present in this case -
site should not be able to guess that their site is blocked because
document.monetization.state never moves from pending_.

It should also be possible to tell the browser a list of sites which can
optionally be paid more than the usual sum. (Use case: web user visits favourite
charity's website.)

## WM Sender Interface

The WM Sender interface is not yet well defined. The current implementation is a
browser extension which plays the role of both browser and sender therefore it
doesn't explicitly define an interface that other senders might use to integrate
with the browser.

One proposal would be to leverage the Payment Handler API but this requires
further exploration.

- Payment Handlers are deployed as service workers which have a very specific
  life-cycle that may not be appropriate for providing an ongoing stream of
  micropayments.
- The interaction between the website and the handler, as defined by the current
  Payment Handler API, is a single request/response exchange and doesn't
  currently allow for a stream-like interface.
