    # Terminology
     - The **user** is the party who is accessing the web-monetized site.

  <section id="goals">
    # Design Goals
     - Should be extremely simple for webmasters to use in their site.
     - Backend infrastructure should be optional; should be usable on a static site.
     - Should not require any interaction with the user.
     - Should give user's agent a choice about how much to spend, and which sites to support.
     - Should give advanced webmasters a way to associate payments with their users, in order to unlock premium experiences.
     - Should pay continuously as the user consumes content.
     - Should be compatible with existing application and transport protocols on Interledger.
