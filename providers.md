# Web Monetization Providers

A WM provider is responsible for making payments to WM receivers. It interfaces with a user's browser to help it determine who to pay, when and how much.

The interface between the browser and the Wm provider is currently not well defined.

Our expectation is that this will be an extension of the Payment Handler API.
