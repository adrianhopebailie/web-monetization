# Web Monetization Senders

A WM sender is responsible for making payments to WM receivers. It interfaces with a user's browser to which sends it payments instructions including who to pay, when and how much.

The interface between the browser and the WM Sender is currently not well defined.

Our expectation is that this will be an extension of the Payment Handler API.
